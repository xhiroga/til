R. Martin and its television adaptation ''Game of Thrones''.  She is a priestess of the god R'hllor (also called the Red God or the Lord of Light) from the continent Essos and a close advisor to King Stannis Baratheon in his campaign to take the Iron Throne. She is often nicknamed '''the Red Woman''' due to the color of her hair and clothes, and has mysterious powers over fire and shadow. She is a prominent example of Martin's use of magic within the story, and is the source of several important prophecies that guide the narrative.\\n\\nIntroduced in ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), Melisandre has come to Westeros to propagate her faith in the Red God.  She subsequently appeared in Martin's ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000) and ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011).  Melisandre is not a point-of-view character in the first four novels, her actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other characters such as Davos Seaworth and Jon Snow.  In the fifth novel ''A Dance with Dragons'', she has a single point-of-view chapter.  \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a40a4880b3ef7b41259a37e2ccd23c7f'}>,\n",

He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998) and ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000). Through his relationship with Tyrion, Bronn is able to quickly attain great wealth, position, and influence in the royal court of King's Landing.\\n\\nBronn is portrayed by Jerome Flynn in the HBO television adaptation. His role was significantly expanded from that in the novels.\\n\\n== Character description ==\\nBronn is sarcastic, with a black sense of humor and a pragmatic, amoral philosophy for life. However, he is neither completely heartless nor sadistic. He openly expresses sympathy to Tyrion Lannister after making the pragmatic decision not to champion him during Lannister's second trial by combat. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '278ad0539d0b2cc9c424a2ade9bababc'}>,\n",
