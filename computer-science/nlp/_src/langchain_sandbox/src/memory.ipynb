      "Summary: Hunter × Hunter (stylized as HUNTER×HUNTER and pronounced \"hunter hunter\") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 37 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\n",
      "Hunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series produced by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001.

      "This new Hunter × Hunter anime was announced on July 24, 2011.

Produced by Nippon TV, VAP, Shueisha and Madhouse, the series is directed by Hiroshi Kōjina, with Atsushi Maekawa and Tsutomu Kamishiro handling series composition, Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the characters and Yoshihisa Hirano composing the music.

The series started to be collected in both DVD and Blu-ray format on January 25, 2012. Viz Media has licensed the anime for a DVD/Blu-ray release in North America with an English dub. On television, the series began airing on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block on April 17, 2016, and ended on June 23, 2019.The anime series' opening theme is alternated between the song \"Departure!\" and an alternate version titled \"Departure! -Second Version-\" both sung by Galneryus' vocalist Masatoshi Ono. Five pieces of music were used as the ending theme; \"Just Awake\" by the Japanese band Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas in episodes 1 to 26, \"Hunting for Your Dream\" by Galneryus in episodes 27 to 58, \"Reason\" sung by Japanese duo Yuzu in episodes 59 to 75, \"Nagareboshi Kirari\" also sung by Yuzu from episode 76 to 98, which was originally from the anime film adaptation, Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge, and \"Hyōri Ittai\" by Yuzu featuring Hyadain from episode 99 to 146, which was also used in the film Hunter × Hunter: The Last Mission. The background music and soundtrack for the series was composed by Yoshihisa Hirano.\n",

      "This new Hunter × Hunter anime was announced on July 24, 2011. It is a complete reboot of the anime adaptation starting from the beginning of the manga, with no connections to the first anime from 1999. Produced by Nippon TV, VAP, Shueisha and Madhouse, the series is directed by Hiroshi Kōjina, with Atsushi Maekawa and Tsutomu Kamishiro handling series composition, Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the characters and Yoshihisa Hirano composing the music. Instead of having the old cast reprise their roles for the new adaptation, the series features an entirely new cast to voice the characters. The new series premiered airing weekly on Nippon TV and the nationwide Nippon News Network from October 2, 2011.  The series started to be collected in both DVD and Blu-ray format on January 25, 2012. Viz Media has licensed the anime for a DVD/Blu-ray release in North America with an English dub. On television, the series began airing on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block on April 17, 2016, and ended on June 23, 2019.The anime series' opening theme is alternated between the song \"Departure!\" and an alternate version titled \"Departure! -Second Version-\" both sung by Galneryus' vocalist Masatoshi Ono. Five pieces of music were used as the ending theme; \"Just Awake\" by the Japanese band Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas in episodes 1 to 26, \"Hunting for Your Dream\" by Galneryus in episodes 27 to 58, \"Reason\" sung by Japanese duo Yuzu in episodes 59 to 75, \"Nagareboshi Kirari\" also sung by Yuzu from episode 76 to 98, which was originally from the anime film adaptation, Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge, and \"Hyōri Ittai\" by Yuzu featuring Hyadain from episode 99 to 146, which was also used in the film Hunter × Hunter: The Last Mission. The background music and soundtrack for the series was composed by Yoshihisa Hirano.\u001b[0m\n",
